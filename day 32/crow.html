        <p>
            A crow  is a bird of the genus Corvus, or more broadly a synonym for all of Corvus.
             Crows are generally black in colour. The word "crow" is used as part of the common
              name of many species. The related term "raven" is not pinned scientifically to any
               certain trait, but is rather a general grouping for larger species of Corvus.crow,
                (genus Corvus), any of various glossy black birds found in most parts of the world,
                 with the exception of southern South America. Crows are generally smaller and not as
                  thick-billed as ravens, which belong to the same genus. A large majority of the 40 
                  or so Corvus species are known as crows, and the name has been applied to other, 
                  unrelated birds. Large crows measure about 0.5 metre (20 inches) long, with wingspans
                   that can reach 1 metre (39 inches).

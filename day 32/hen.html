            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl 
            species that are originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially 
            hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey junglefowl, 
            Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl). Rooster and cock are terms 
            for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that 
            has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a 
            sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as
             a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally 
             they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. 
             Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.

        <p>
            Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and 
            Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants 
            and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl 
            are referred to as peahens, although peafowl of either sex are often referred 
            to colloquially as "peacocks."The two Asiatic species are the blue or 
            Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl of 
            Southeast Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the 
            Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant 
            plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an 
            eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a 
            courtship ritual.

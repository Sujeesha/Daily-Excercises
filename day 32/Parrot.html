        <h1>PARROT</h1>
        <p>
            Parrots are birds of the order Psittaciformes. There are about 372 species in 86 
            genera. They are found in most tropical and subtropical regions. 
            The greatest diversity of parrots is found in South America and Australasia.Parrots
             are intelligent birds. They have relatively large brains, they can learn, 
             and they can use simple tools. Because some species have the ability to make
              sounds like human voices and have plumages with bright colors, many species 
              are kept as pets. This includes some endangered and protected species.

            Parrots have a compact body with a large head and a short neck. Their beaks are 
            short, strong and curved. The two parts of the beak are very strong and used to 
            break fruits and seeds. The tongue is large and strong. Most parrots can fly, 
            though some lost their powers of flight after they came to live on oceanic islands.
             The kakapo is an example.Parrots have strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet 
             (with two toes facing forward and two toes facing back) that are very useful 
             to climb up trees. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. 
             The plumage of cockatoos ranges from mostly white to mostly black, with a mobile 
             crest of feathers on the tops of their heads. Most parrots exhibit little or no 
             sexual dimorphism.

        Parrots eat seeds, nuts, buds and other plant material. A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion 
        (dead animal carcasses), while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and 
        soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows, and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young.Parrots 
        are among the most intelligent birds. The ability of some parrots to make sounds like human voices makes them 
        popular as pets.

            The capture of wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss and competition from 
            invasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation 
            than any other group of birds.[8] Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile species 
            have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.[9]Some parrots can 
            live up to 80 years. Many parrots can imitate human speech; they can speak simple words if repeated a few times.

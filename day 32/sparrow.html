        <p>
            The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae,
             found in most parts of the world. It is a small bird that has a typical length of 
             16 cm (6.3 in). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, 
             and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25 species 
             in the genus Passer, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the 
             Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia. Its intentional or accidental 
             introductions to many regions, including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the
              Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.
